Python Script to Scrape CrossFit Open Data

Basically all of the work was done by `captamericadevs <https://github.com/captamericadevs>`__ as discussed in his blog posts `1 <https://captamericadevs.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/open-2017-data/>`__, `2 <https://captamericadevs.wordpress.com/2017/02/13/open-data-from-2012-2016/>`__and `3 <https://captamericadevs.wordpress.com/2016/12/15/crossfit-open-data/>`__.

I'm planning to add plotting using `Holoviews <https://github.com/ioam/holoviews>`__.
