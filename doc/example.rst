Example
============

Test the code `DataExtract/get17Scores.py`.
This will call `extractScoresMainSite.extractScoresMainSite.py`

Get 2017 data::

    cd DataExtract
    python get17Scores.py
    
This writes the file: Scores/2017_Scores_Men.csv

The last name is Ron Lyman. Can't work out why it isn't Sean Wray like in the URL
Ron Lyman is last on the second last page. TO DO increase the loop by 1
